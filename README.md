# InexRef.EventSourcing

A simple reference implementation of Event Sourcing for educational purposes.

This is *not* intended as a production implementation.

You may notice a passing similarity to [Greg Young's "Simplest Possible Thing" solution](https://github.com/gregoryyoung/m-r). This solution, written by Greg some years ago, together with and both his and Udi Dahan's posts, presentations and courses on CQRS and event sourcing, started me down the path of event sourcing some years ago. This repo represents my best attempt to describe it simply to other people.
